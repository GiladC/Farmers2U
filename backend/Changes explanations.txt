I changed the database so that it will use something called migrations.
Migrations means that changes you do in the models.py file will
update on the database, before it was done these changes didn't 
change the database for me. Here is how you do it:
1) install the module using: pip install flask-migrate
2) run: flask db init
3) Go to migrations folder, and to alembic.ini,
there put at the end of the file (after the last line) the line:
sqlalchemy.url = sqlite:///flaskdb.db
4) run: flask db migrate -m "Initial migration"
5) run: flask db upgrade


Now if anytime during the code you change the database and want to
save the changes, you open the cmd (or terminal) at the directory,
and do the following steps:
1) run: flask db migrate -m "Description of the change
2) run: flask db upgrade
