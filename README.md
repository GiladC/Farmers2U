# Farmers2U - Group Number 3

## Introduction

Welcome to the **Farmers2U** ,a platform for farmers and consumers created by a group of CS students at Tel Aviv University. This platform serves as a bridge between local farmers and consumers, allowing farmers to showcase their goods and consumers to discover and connect with them. This website benefits all - it allowes the farmer to publish his buisness and his marketing events as well as sell his goods without having to split shares with importers and marketers, and on the other hand, allowes the consumer to purchase the best products straight from the farmer and support local israeli agriculture.

## Key Features

## Bulletin Board
Much like Facebook connects people globally, the Bulletin Board virtually brings farmers and consumers together. It's a space where farmers can share their stories, products, and experiences while consumers discover and support local agriculture.

## Bulletin Board Filter Panel
Allow users to display relevant posts by filtering based on dates, proximity to their location, and product categories.

## Our Farmers Filter Panel
Lets users find suitable farmers by applying filters such as shipping availability, shipping policies, and product types.

## Add Post
Farmers can add posts and advertise selling events. Posts can then be easily edited or deleted.

## Business Cards
Farmers create their own business cards easily during the signup process. The business card, including all information, posts, and pictures, can then be easily edited through the Personal Settings page. Consumers, on the other hand, can explore a variety of business cards, extract any information necessary, scroll through farmers' previous posts, and contact the farmer for further inquiries.
